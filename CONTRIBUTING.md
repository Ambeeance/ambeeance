# Contributing

Contributions to Ambeeance are welcome. Please make sure you review this document carefully to minimise waste.

## Bugs
If your contribution is intended to fix a bug please raise an [Issue](https://github.com/Ambeeance/ambeeance/issues), apply the `bug` label and ask for it to be assigned to you. PRs to fix bugs which do not have issues cannot be merged and being assigned the Issue guarantees that the behaviour is both a bug and that project maintainers are happy to adopt the fix.

## Features
If your contribution is intended to deliver/expand a feature please raise an [Issue](https://github.com/Ambeeance/ambeeance/issues), apply the `enhancement` label and ask for it to be assigned to you. PRs which do not have issues cannot be merged and being assigned the Issue guarantees that the project maintainers are happy to adopt the feature.


## Project Management
In the long run I expect to move to GitHub Projects for ticket management but in the interim I'm using a public [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Y5Ja5qxc/%F0%9F%90%9D-ambeeance).
